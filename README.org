* qmcmc: an R package for simple MCMC routines

Several MCMC routines are included with a common interface:
Metropolis-Hastings, slice sampling, and Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo.  All you need to do is specify a function that computes an
unnormalized density (e.g. a posterior distribution).  For HMC, you'll
need to set the attribute of this value to be the gradient.

This is a similar effort to Radford Neal's GRIMS scripts.  This package
is less general and flexible, but so far I have found it easier to debug and extend.
