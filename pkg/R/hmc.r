# SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF HAMILTONIAN MONTE CARLO.
#
# Radford M. Neal, 2010.
#
# This program appears in Figure 2 of "MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics",
# to appear in the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
#
# The arguments to the HMC function are as follows:
#
#   U          A function to evaluate minus the log of the density of the
#              distribution to be sampled, plus any constant - ie, the
#              "potential energy".
#
#   grad_U     A function to evaluate the gradient of U.
#
#   epsilon    The stepsize to use for the leapfrog steps.
#
#   L          The number of leapfrog steps to do to propose a new state.
#
#   current_q  The current state (position variables only).
#
# Momentum variables are sampled from independent standard normal
# distributions within this function.  The value return is the vector
# of new position variables (equal to current_q if the endpoint of the
# trajectory was rejected).
#
# This function was written for illustrative purposes.  More elaborate
# implementations of this basic HMC method and various variants of HMC
# are available from my web page, http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/


HMC = function (U, grad_U, epsilon, L, current_q)
{
  q = current_q
  p = rnorm(length(q),0,1)  # independent standard normal variates
  current_p = p

  # Make a half step for momentum at the beginning

  p = p - epsilon * grad_U(q) / 2

  # Alternate full steps for position and momentum

  for (i in 1:L)
  {
    # Make a full step for the position

    q = q + epsilon * p

    # Make a full step for the momentum, except at end of trajectory

    if (i!=L) p = p - epsilon * grad_U(q)
  }

  # Make a half step for momentum at the end.

  p = p - epsilon * grad_U(q) / 2

  # Negate momentum at end of trajectory to make the proposal symmetric

  p = -p

  # Evaluate potential and kinetic energies at start and end of trajectory

  current_U = U(current_q)
  current_K = sum(current_p^2) / 2
  proposed_U = U(q)
  proposed_K = sum(p^2) / 2

  # Accept or reject the state at end of trajectory, returning either
  # the position at the end of the trajectory or the initial position

  if (runif(1) < exp(current_U-proposed_U+current_K-proposed_K))
  {
    return (q)  # accept
  }
  else
  {
    return (current_q)  # reject
  }
}
